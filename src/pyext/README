The module 'extioctl', 'lowlevel' are developed for the self-implemented
partition code. But I decide to use GNU Parted now, so they are removed.
These code are preserved for future requirement. If the others required
them, they will be added again.
The module 'isys' is imported from anaconda because some operations are
not supported by python directly. I do some change on it to fit the
requirement of MagicInstaller.
